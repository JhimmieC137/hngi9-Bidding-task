# hngi9-Bidding-task

## This was a task to create a script to convert the data of each row a csv file to a json file, hash each of those json files in SHA-256 and append the hash in a new column of a new copy of the initial csv file.

### This script was created using Team_Bevel.csv as a sample and the respective json files and new csv were created as seen in the folder

## To run the script: 
- Clone the repository
- Open the 'Bidding task' folder in your text editor
- Paste your csv file there
- Run the script in your terminal with 'Python fetcher.py'

Note:
      Open fetcher.py and edit line 56 to the path/name of your csv file i.e jsonifier('path/to/your/file or name of your file').
      Also edit line 28 to 29 to change the naming convention of each json file to be created.
      Edit line 49 to change the name of the new csv file.
      Edit anything else to suite your format and desired result.
